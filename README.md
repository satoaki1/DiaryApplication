# DiaryApplication
Simple Diary Application created with Django framework in Python.  
The .idea file involves packages involved in virtualenv, but those packages would not be cloned together.  
Therefore, when to edit this project to renew the application, kindly install the venv with "pip install virtualenv" command and create the venv directory for the project edition.
